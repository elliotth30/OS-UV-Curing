<b>So What Is This Project?</b>


This project is an open-source hardware and code project for mainboards to run UV curing stations/devices. The main use cases for these would be SLA 3D printing where parts need to be UV cured or for certain photosensitive chemical processing such as cyanotypes. _(more examples projects to come)_

**So why not just use a standard Arduino or alternative Microcontroller?**

I hope to create an open library with selectable options to allow people from the 3D printing scene or other scenes who arenâ€™t familiar with microcontrollers but want to create their own custom solutions. I think this is a neat way of people getting to create custom solutions for their own projects whilst being able to learn a new skill in computing _(whilst not diving in at the deep end)_ although this project is entirely open source - you will be able to buy kits from myself or pre-soldered boards to make things easier and probably cheaper per person!

I've used the Raspberry Pi foundations latest PICO board with the custom RP2040 silicon as it's a trusted brand name for many hobbyists (especially within the 3D printing scene with the Raspberry Pi name being known, for example as the widely used Octoprint already being commonplace)

**So What Features Does The Board Pack?**

_(well if you know your way around a microcontroller the only limitations are your own)_ However, the board has been designed with modularity in mind - with a large range of JST connectors to connect directly to your own hardware such as buttons LED'S and motors. I've chosen to use JST connectors for a few reasons: the first being that again it is widely used in 3D print, secondly it's fairly foolproof in terms of plugging them in the correct way round due to the tabs and lastly they're cheap/easy to use/abundant and secure, unlike standard pin connectors which commonly lose connection or fall/pull off.
